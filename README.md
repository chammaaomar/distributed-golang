Working through [Distributed Services with Go](https://pragprog.com/titles/tjgo/distributed-services-with-go/)

## Part 1
- Writing a commit log

### TODO
- Look into using [afero](https://github.com/spf13/afero) for mocking and more dependency injection stuff for testing
- Look into programming more to interfaces than implementation for more robust code
